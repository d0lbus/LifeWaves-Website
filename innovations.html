            <p>Healthy maritime ecosystems are essential to European well-being, yet they are under threat from overexploitation, pollution, habitat degradation, and climate change. The EU has made good strides toward expanding marine protected areas (MPAs) and reviving fish stocks, especially in the North-East Atlantic, in order to meet Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14. But issues like eutrophication, plastic and chemical pollution, and ocean acidification still pose a threat to marine life.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Increased CO2 absorption causes ocean acidification, which is especially dangerous in polar regions. Meanwhile, marine trash and nutrient pollution continue to pose serious risks. Even while the quality of coastal water has improved, especially at EU bathing places, there are still larger issues.</p>

    <div class="trends-wrapper2">
        <img src="images/OceanPreservation.jpg" alt="">
        <div class="trends-text-box">
            <p>The creation of MPAs is one step toward preserving marine biodiversity, but many of them lack efficient management strategies, which reduces their effectiveness. While the EU is striving to meet its international obligations—such as preserving thirty percent of the ocean by 2030—the majority of marine species and their habitats are still in poor condition.</p>
            <br>
            <p>A major factor in encouraging sustainable fishing methods is the European Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), which will cut fishing pressure by 44% between 2006 and 2021. More focused efforts are necessary because overfishing in the Mediterranean and Black Seas persists. The CFP is supported by the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, which guarantees a healthy age and size distribution of fish populations. However, the fact that long-term stock biomass remains stable underscores the continued complexity of fisheries management.</p>
